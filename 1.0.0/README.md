## Overview

FOGHORN is a specialized RAIL DIN board designed for seamless integration with ESP8266 NodeMCU v3 modules. Measuring 76mm x 86mm, this board features two screw holes with 25mm center to center apart, making installation easy. Equipped with 2 rows of 15-pin female headers, it simplifies the mounting of NodeMCU V3 modules.

The board boasts a 5-pin female header, offering the flexibility to integrate a DHT sensor into projects. With 5 terminal screw blocks and male/female headers mapped to GROUND, GPIO pins 4, 5, 12, and 14, users can assign and utilize these pins as output pins for their projects. Additionally, a 10-pin two-row female header allows quick LED testing of the 4, 5, 12, and 14 GPIO pins, facilitating hassle-free functionality checks without complicated wiring.

The inclusion of a 2-pin male and female header mapped to the A0 analog pin of the ESP module simplifies the connection of analog sensors without jumper wires. With two terminal blocks supporting 5VDC or 12VDC power options for the board and ESP module, this board provides a versatile solution for electronics projects.
